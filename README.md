# my-portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio. My journey at the UCD Coding Bootcamp has been a long one but as I have been approaching the final weeks I have been challenged with building my own portfolio using React.js. This project has been a lot of fun and was a test of both my coding and design skills.

Viewers can see my Resume, portfolio of projects, contact me, and down load my resume.
